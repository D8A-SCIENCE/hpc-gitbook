# Student Manual for using the HPC @ William and Mary for Data Science

This is a how-to manual for using the [High Performance Computing (HPC)](https://www.wm.edu/offices/it/services/researchcomputing/) resources at William and Mary for [Data Science](https://github.com/D8A-SCIENCE) and distributed ML.  

**The site is [deployed live here](https://d8a-science.github.io/hpc-gitbook/).**  

This site is a fork of [@heatherbaier](https://github.com/heatherbaier/)'s Gitbook [here](https://hmbaier.gitbook.io/distributed-ml-w-and-m) and uses Jekyll and the Cayman theme.
