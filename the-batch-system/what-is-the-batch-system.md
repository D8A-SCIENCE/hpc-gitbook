# ðŸ‘©ðŸŒ¾ What is the batch system?

Think of the HPC like a community garden - users reserve individual plots within a garden space so that people can't plant in their area and they have room to grow what they wish. Think of a whole sub-cluster (i.e. Vortex) as the garden and each of the nodes as a plot you can reserve. By submitting jobs, we reserve the resources on the nodes for ourselves. If we were to run python scripts, programs, etc.. without submitting jobs, we would all constantly be fighting for resources and our regularly collide with each other. This is what would happen if you were to log into the HPC and run a python program outside of a job - you would essentially be using resources that you did not fairly check out (i.e. you would be planting your veggies in everyone else's garden plots).

### How the Job Queue works

stuff about gaging walltime, not taking more memory than you need, etc...
