# Distributed ML @ W\&M

## Welcome aboard!

This is a how-to manual for using the [High Performance Computing (HPC)](https://www.wm.edu/offices/it/services/researchcomputing/) resources at William and Mary for [Data Science](https://github.com/D8A-SCIENCE) and distributed ML.  

Please hold down control on your keyboard and then refresh this website to get the most recent content.  Github uses very aggressive caching strategies, so you may get outdated material without doing a full clear of the cache on each page in this book.

This site is hosted by Github, and it is created and maintained by students --- check out the [project repository](https://github.com/D8A-SCIENCE/hpc-gitbook) for more information and opportunities to contribute.
