# Example Dataset

The dataset we'll be using for each of the examples is from the Global Education Observatory (GEO) project. The imagery is from Landsat and is the 256x256 pixel bounding box around schools in Mexico, the Philippines and Brazil. They variable we are predicting is the average national achievement test score obtained by students at that school during a given year. This dataset is not large compared to the datasets you would normally to use for distributed training, however it serves as a great, clean datset for example purposes.

The imagery can be accessed using Vortex and is located at `/sciclone/geograd/CCI/hmbaier/` and the CSV contained the Y variable used in training is located at `/sciclone/geograd/CCI/hmbaier/cci_final.csv`
