# ðŸŽ‰ Requesting an Account

In order to use the high performance computing environments at William & Mary, you must first request access for your W&M user ID. You initiate this process by **following the instructions [here](https://wm.edu/offices/it/services/researchcomputing/acctreq/index.php)**.

> This process is not automated, and thus it can take a few days before your new account permissions are enabled.

If you work in a specific research lab on campus (for example, [geoLab](https://geolab.wm.edu)), it is important to note that in your account signup, as that will allow the HPC team to give your account appropriate permissions for both files and computational resources.
